## Context
In this policy brief, we aim to measure the relationship between a range of area-level social, economic and demographic variables and new COVID-19 cases over time in England, particularly during the second wave of the pandemic. We seek to determine the extent to which pre-existing spatial socio-demographic inequalities have shaped the geographic spread of the pandemic; and, identify key local characteristics that might explain a high prevalence of COVID-19 cases. Results will provide policy-relevant evidence for local government agencies and national government, emphasising the greater urgency for tackling existing spatial socio-demographic inequalities; and, identifying local contextual factors which can augment the impact of the pandemic. Such evidence is of particular to the Liverpool City Region, where levels of deprivation are acute and COVID cases rapidly increased during the second wave. The policy brief analyses the geography of the COVID-19 pandemic in England focusing on three questions:

  (1) Spatial - *Where are COVID-19 cases spatially concentrated?*
  
  (2) Social - *Which socio-demographic characteristics are most strongly associated with a high prevalence of COVID-19?*
  
  (3) Socio-spatial - *Which socio-demographic characteristics are most strongly associated with high COVID-19 cases across different parts of England?*

## Methods

**Scale of analysis:** We explored changes over time (from March until November) amongst 151 Upper-Tier Local Authorities (UTLAs) in England. UTLAs are made up of a number of different types of geographical units: Metropolitan Districts (n = 36), London Boroughs (n = 32) plus City of London (n = 1), Unitary Authorities (n = 55) plus Isle of Scilly (n = 1), and County Councils (n = 26). In the reporting of COVID-cases Cornwall and Isles of Scilly are combined into a single unit, in addition to Hackney and City of London, leaving a total of 149 UTLA in our analysis.
