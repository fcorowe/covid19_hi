## Scale of analysis

We explored changes over time (from March until November) amongst 151 Upper-Tier Local Authorities (UTLAs) in England. UTLAs are made up of a number of different types of geographical units: Metropolitan Districts (n = 36), London Boroughs (n = 32) plus City of London (n = 1), Unitary Authorities (n = 55) plus Isle of Scilly (n = 1), and County Councils (n = 26). In the reporting of COVID-cases Cornwall and Isles of Scilly are combined into a single unit, in addition to Hackney and City of London, leaving a total of 149 UTLA in our analysis.
